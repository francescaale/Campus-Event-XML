# Campus-Event-XML

This is a web-based platform designed to showcase and promote campus events. The site allows students and staff to explore upcoming events, view detailed information, and engage with the campus community. The event details are dynamically loaded using **XML** for structured data representation.

Used

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap (for responsive design)
- **Data Representation**: XML (to store and structure event information)
- **JavaScript**: To parse XML and display event details dynamically
- **Backend**: No backend (Static website using XML for data)

How It Works

- **XML Data**: Event details (date, time, location, description) are stored in **XML files**.
- **Dynamic Display**: JavaScript is used to fetch and display event details dynamically from the XML file on the web page.
- **Responsive Design**: The site is fully responsive using **Bootstrap**, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
